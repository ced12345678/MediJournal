## Key Features

- **Interactive Life Timeline**: A unique, collapsible timeline view that visualizes a user's entire health history, grouped by age, making complex medical histories easy to understand at a glance.
- **Specialized Health Views**: Dedicated sections for Doctor Visits, Medications, and Diseases, allowing users to quickly access and manage specific types of health information.
- **AI-Powered Family History Analysis**: An integrated AI chat to help users build a structured family medical history and identify potential hereditary risk factors (Note: AI features are disabled in the demo to manage costs).
- **Secure PDF Export**: Users can generate a comprehensive, shareable PDF summary of their health record to take to their doctor, ensuring they always have their information when they need it.
- **100% Client-Side**: A fully featured application that runs entirely in the browser with no backend server dependency.

## Privacy & Data Storage

For this hackathon prototype, **MediJournal uses the browser's local storage exclusively**. 

In a real-world application, this model would be extended to use a secure, HIPAA-compliant database where user data would be stored with robust encryption and anonymization techniques to ensure absolute privacy and security at scale.
